         <div class="loan-offer-container no-border">
            <p class="no-border">Usually, a personal loan is not restricted in terms of its utilisation. That is, you can use your personal loan for any purpose as long as it is legal. However, there are certain lenders who provide different loan products on the basis of the purpose which is mentioned by the borrower in the personal loan application. On the basis of utilisation, these are the different types of personal loans which can be availed in India:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b><a href="marriage-loan.html">Personal Loan for Wedding:</a></b> As the name suggests, a personal loan which is offered particularly for the purpose of meeting the expenses of a wedding is a wedding loan.</li>

         <p class="p-heading">How to Improve your Chances of Getting a Personal Loan?</p>
         <div class="loan-offer-container no-border">
            <ul>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>Credit Clean-up:</b> One of the main factors taken into consideration by lenders is your credit score. Getting a personal loan is easier with a high credit score. If your score is low, you must check your reports to see if there are any errors. Sometimes, simple errors could have an adverse effect on your scores, and if you find any of these, you must report them to CIBIL.</li>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>Rebalancing your income and debts:</b> Lenders ask for proof of income when you apply for personal loans in order to ascertain your debt-to-income ratio. Consider the sale of liquid assets like stocks or earning more through a part-time job to increase your annual income. Doing so will increase your debt-to-income ratio and increase your chances of getting a personal loan.</li>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>Consider Co-signers/Guarantors: </b>Consider Co-signers/Guarantors: If you are finding it hard to get a personal loan on your own accord, you can apply for one by adding a co-signer or guarantor. The person you choose as a guarantor must have a good credit score. Their main aim is to guarantee that you will repay the loan. However, they will also be liable to repay the loan themselves if you are unable to do so. Picking an individual with a credit score over 750 will considerably increase your chances of getting a personal loan.</li>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>Limit Your Borrowing: </b>It can be risky to ask for more money than you require to meet your financial targets. Make sure that you calculate how much you need and apply only for that specific amount.</li>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>Choose the Right Lender:</b> Every lender has their own requirements when it comes to credit scores and income. When looking for personal loans, pick a lender whose eligibility criteria you meet and apply accordingly. The problem with applying with multiple lenders is that each of them will check your credit score, and each time your full credit report is pulled out, your credit score drops, albeit marginally.</li>

         <p class="p-heading no-border">Pre-Payment and Part Payment of Personal Loan</p>
         <div class="loan-offer-container no-border">
            <p class="no-border">A personal loan is given for a stipulated time period. This period is known as the loan repayment tenure. After you have taken a loan, you are expected to pay the debt off by the end of the loan repayment tenure through EMIs. However, after availing a personal loan, if you decide to pay off your debt before the end of the loan repayment period, it is called pre-payment or foreclosure.</p>
            <p class="p-heading no-border">Types of Pre-Payment:</p>
            <p class="no-border">There are 2 types of pre-payment. They are – full pre-payment and part pre-payment or just part payment.</p>
            <p class="p-heading no-border">1. Full Pre-Payment:</p>
            <p class="no-border">If you are paying off the whole outstanding loan amount before the end of the loan repayment tenure, it is known as full pre-payment.</p>
            <p class="p-heading no-border">Advantages of full pre-payment:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> You can avoid paying hefty interest on your loan amount.</li>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> You can avoid paying pre-payment interest as well, if you have taken the loan from a lender who does not charge an interest on pre-payment of the loan.</li>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> If you have the money to pay off your debt completely, you might as well get rid of the debt.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-heading no-border">Disadvantages of Full Pre-Payment:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> If your lender charges a penalty on pre-payment of the loan amount, you might have to pay a big chunk of money for pre-paying your loan.</li>
               <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right small-font mr-1" aria-hidden="true"></i> Before you foreclose a personal loan, check the other factors related to it. Foreclosing a personal loan means that you would be paying out a huge sum of money at once. This might not always be the best option.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-heading no-border">2. Part pre-payment:</p>

            <p class="p-heading no-border">Things to do After Closing a Personal Loan?</p>
            <p class="no-border">If you have recently paid off your personal loan (either repaid or foreclosed), you might have the idea that your obligation towards the loan is over. However, that is not the case. There are certain things that you should do after paying off your personal loan.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>The No Dues Certificate or NDC:</b> The No Dues Certificate or NDC is issued by your lender once you pay off the debt. This is one of the most important documents that you should collect immediately after paying off your loan. It is also a wise decision to retain this document for an extended period of time. This certificate validates the repayment that you have made. Without this document you cannot prove that you have paid off your debts. In case you are looking forward to taking another loan in the near future, you will need this document to prove that your previous loan has been paid off. Usually, this document is issued on spot by your lender if you are paying off the final amount through hard cash. If you are paying via check or NEFT or any other means, the lender will issue the NDC and will either send it to your registered address or will ask you to collect it from the branch office of the lender.</li>
               <li><b>The Statement of Account or SoA: </b>The Statement of Account or SoA, along with the NDC will help you prove that your debts have been completely paid off and have been paid on time. This is an optional document which is often issued by certain lenders. If your lender provides this document, you should consider getting it. However, you should also look for any sorts of discrepancies in the credit score. If you find something wrong, you can use the SoA to make the necessary changes to it.</li>
               <li><b>Collection of unused cheques:</b> If you have some cheque leaves which have not been used, you should collect those as well. The collection of the No Dues Certificate and the unused cheque leaves, usually, marks the end of the closure process for the loan.</li>
               <li><b>Check your credit score after closing the loan:</b> This is just a recommendation. It is not compulsory to check the credit score after the closure process ends. However, it is recommended that you check the score to make sure there are no differences in the score. If there are some chances of you availing another loan within 1 to 2 years of the closure of the current loan, it is highly recommended that you check the credit scores right after the closure of the loan.</li>

            <p class="p-heading no-border">Modes of Personal Loan Payment or Repayment</p>
            <p class="no-border">There are a number of repayment modes which are offered by lenders. Although these modes might differ from lender to lender, the most common modes of repayment can be summed up as follows:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>Electronic Clearance System or ECS: </b> The ECS or Electronic Clearance System is one of the most commonly used repayment methods. It is an electronic mode through which funds are transferred from one bank to another.</li>
               <li><b>Post Dated Cheques or PDCs:</b> Post Dated Cheques, as the name suggests, are cheques which are issued by you for a future date. The lender will use these cheques on the mentioned date to deposit or encash the amount mentioned on it.</li>
               <li><b>National Automated Clearing House:</b> The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) offers a program called NACH to all the banks and financial institutions. The NACH allows the processing of transactions in real time. This method can be used for your loan repayments.</li>
               <li><b>Debit mandate or standing instruction:</b> You can give an instruction to your bank to pay off a particular amount of money to another bank or bank account at a regular interval. This is known as standing instruction or debit mandate. Your bank will be paying off the stipulated amount towards the repayment of your loan on a regular basis through this system.</li>

            <p class="no-border">There are two main modes of checking the status of your personal loan application. Most lenders offer both online and offline modes through which you can keep tracking your personal loan status.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>1. Online Mode:</b> Most lenders offer the option of logging in to their official portal to help you track the status of your loan application. You can use the application number or reference number which is issued by the lender for this purpose. On the other hand, if you have applied for a personal loan through a third-party aggregator website such as BankBazaar, you can just log in to its web portal and track the status of your personal loan application directly.</li>
               <li><b>2. Offline Mode:</b> If you are not comfortable using the online platform, you can also track the status of your personal loan application through the offline means. You can visit the branch office of your loan provider and check the status of your loan application. On the other hand, you can also connect with your lender over the telephone through their helpline or customer care number.</li>

            <p class="no-border">Personal disbursal is basically the process of the financial lender remitting the loan amount in the bank account of the customer. The personal loan disbursal takes place after the submission of relevant documents of the customer and the verification and approval of the financial lender. Financial lenders offer personal loan disbursals in a few seconds, while other take a few hours to a few days to disburse the loan amount following approval.</p>

                           A personal loan is a type of unsecured loan that that you can borrow from a bank or financial institution if you require funds to pay for your financial needs.

                           You borrow a personal loan when you are in need of credit. Once you submit your loan application to a lender for a personal loan, the lender verifies and approves it. Post this, the loan amount is disbursed into your bank account. Once you receive the loan amount, you will need to repay the lender via EMIs over the course of the loan repayment tenure.

                           EMI or Equal Monthly Installment is the amount that a borrower pays each month towards an outstanding loan to clear off the debt within a specific time frame. EMI includes principal and interest.

                           A credit score or rating is a number that indicates how you repay debt. It is important because your score determines whether you qualify for loans, credit cards, and other credit facilities.

                           Your credit score is an indicator of how you handle your finances. It considers your credit card bill payment history, repayment of past and current loans, and other criteria. Your credit rating tells lenders how likely you are to repay them if they grant you a loan. The better your credit score, the better the chances are of getting a higher loan amount.

                           If you happen to get some extra money, you can pay it towards your loan even before the EMIs are due. This is called a prepayment. Every prepayment you make goes towards reducing the outstanding principal component of your loan. And since the principal reduces, your interest cost will also reduce. Also, your tenure gets shortened this way, helping you pay off the loan ahead of time.

Thus, if you have a monthly income of Rs.60,000, you can be fairly certain that you won’t find it difficult to borrow a personal loan. The exact amount that you will be offered will, however, vary based on your repayment capacity, debt-to-income ratio, the lender’s terms and conditions, etc.

You can use a personal loan eligibility calculator tool to know how much you are eligible to borrow with a monthly salary of Rs.25,000.

The key benefit of a personal loan is that you can pay monthly instalments to repay your borrowed loan amount. Further, you can also choose a repayment tenure between 1 year and 5 years to suit your repayment ability. Credit cards, on the other hand, are a good choice if you want to finance smaller expenses, provided that you can repay your balance in full at the end of every month.

                           Most lenders will allow you to make pre-payments or pre-close your loan during the loan repayment term. You will, however, have to pay a nominal charge to the lender for doing the same. Keep in mind that most lenders will only allow you to prepay or pre-close your loan after 1 year of borrowing the loan. If you want to prepay/pre-close your loan, ensure that you inform your lender of the same.

                           Prior to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a service charge of 15% was applicable to personal loans. Post the introduction of the GST on 1 July 2017, a service tax of 18% is applicable on personal loans. Thus, there is a 3% increase in the payable service tax. The service tax, however, is only levied on the processing fee, prepayment charges, etc., and not on EMI payments.

                           You can cancel your personal loan application before the loan amount is disbursed into your account by submitting a written application for the same. You will also need to pay the loan cancellation fee to the lender. Once the loan amount has been disbursed into your account, most lenders will not allow you to cancel it. You can, however, pre-close the loan. If you are thinking of cancelling your loan because you pay a high interest rate on your loan, you can consider transferring your outstanding loan balance to another bank or financial institution.

                           Personal loans are usually unsecured loans. Sometimes, if you don’t fulfil the loan criteria, you may be able to get a loan by offering collateral. In such cases, you have to be extra careful about repaying the loan on time. If you default on your repayment, the lender may take possession of your collateral to cover their losses. Defaulting in such circumstances could make you lose your collateral.
